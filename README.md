## Our Product: Oilert
### Overview
Oilert is an intelligent car maintenance tracking app designed to help users log mileage, oil changes, and other routine vehicle upkeep tasks. Think of it as version control for your car. The app calculates miles per gallon (MPG), estimates the next oil change based on real usage, and helps vehicle owners save money by preventing premature or unnecessary maintenance.

### Features
  - **Multi-Vehicle Support** – Track multiple cars in a single app
  - **Fuel Logging & MPG Calculation** – Monitor fuel efficiency over time
  - **Maintenance Reminders** – Set alerts for oil changes, tire rotations, and more
  - **Service History Tracking** – Keep a detailed log of past maintenance

### Why It Matters
Regular vehicle maintenance is essential for longevity and cost savings. By providing data-driven maintenance tracking, Oilert helps users:
  - Reduce unnecessary oil changes, saving both money and resources
  - Maintain a reliable service history, potentially increasing resale value

### What We Accomplished in 24 Hours
While we were unable to fully implement a working application within the hackathon timeframe, we gained valuable insights into the project’s scope and technical requirements. We refined our project vision, established a clear data structure, and improved our team coordination by resolving initial miscommunications. By the end of the event, we had a solid foundation that we can build upon to develop a fully functional application in the future.

### The Future
Our goal is to evolve Oilert into a comprehensive vehicle maintenance management tool. Future enhancements will include:
  - **Expanded Maintenance Tracking** – Monitoring oil changes, filter replacements, coolant levels, and other critical services based on real usage data and manufacturer guidelines.
  - **Predictive Service Alerts** – Utilizing historical data to anticipate maintenance needs, similar to how we calculate miles per gallon.
  - **Secure and Verifiable Records** – Implementing encryption and digital signatures to create tamper-proof maintenance logs, ensuring trustworthy service histories for vehicle owners, especially when selling a car.

With further development, Oilert has the potential to become an industry-standard solution for vehicle upkeep, providing data-driven insights and secure maintenance tracking for individual users and automotive businesses alike.
